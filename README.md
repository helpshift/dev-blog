# Adding a new post

Create a new file inside `_posts` named in this format: `YYYY-MM-DD-my-new-post.md`.

Inside the file, you need to add a preamble that looks like this:

```
---
layout: post
title: My New Post
tags: tag1 tag2
author:
    name: John Doe
    email: john@ludicorp.com
    meta: President of Vice
---
```

After the preamble you can write the post in Markdown.

# Setup & running

To build the blog and get a live preview you need to install Jekyll and
Grunt.

## Jekyll setup

1. Get Bundler - `gem install bundler`
2. Get Jekyll and dependencies - do a `bundle install` inside the
project directory.
3. Run `jekyll build`

## Grunt setup

To setup live preivew, you need to install `npm`. After installing `npm`
you can just do a `npm install` inside the project directory.

Once `npm` has installed all dependencies you can call `grunt` inside
the project directory.

Grunt will then automatically compile any changes to the blog posts and
serve them via an internal webserver at the url `http://localhost:4000/`
