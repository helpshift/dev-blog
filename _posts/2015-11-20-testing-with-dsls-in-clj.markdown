## Background
Testing business logic quickly becomes tricky, as applications grow and scale. Example based unit and integration tests, and exploratory tests become poor choices to check and verify a large state space. Also such methods are not well-suited to clearly describe the state space / transitions we want to test.

For quite some time I have been experimenting with DSLs to write our tests at Helpshift. I recently gave a talk on "Testing business logic using DSLs in Clojure" at Functional Conf this year. I have shared my learning in the talk. Hope you enjoy it. Feel free to ask me any questions if you have.
